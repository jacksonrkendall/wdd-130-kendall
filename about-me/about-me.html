<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
<p>I am a 5th semester Junior at BYUI, studying CIT with an interest in cybersecurity. 
I have an interest in Penetration Testing as a career, which I have developed over the years through watching various people in the field like

<p>I am the oldest of five kids in my family, and the first to go to BYUI since my parents attended Rick's College. </p>
